        <h3>Early Years</h3>
        <p>
            The Early Years stage is for children aged 3 to 5 years.<br>
            The curriculum is based on the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework, which is used in England and Wales.<br>
            The EYFS framework sets out seven areas of learning and development.<br>
            All areas of learning and development are important and inter-connected.<br>
            Three areas are particularly crucial for igniting childrenâ€™s curiosity and enthusiasm for learning, and for building their capacity to learn,<br>
            form relationships and thrive. These three areas, the prime areas, are:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication and language</li>
            <li>Physical development</li>
            <li>Personal, social and emotional development</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            We also support children in four specific areas, through which the three prime areas are strengthened and applied.<br>
            The specific areas are:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Literacy</li>
            <li>Mathematics</li>
            <li>Understanding the world</li>
            <li>Expressive arts and design</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            The curriculum is delivered through a combination of teacher-directed activities and child-initiated play.<br>
            The curriculum is delivered in English, with an emphasis on the development of high standards of literacy and numeracy.<br>
            The curriculum is enriched by a wide range of extra-curricular activities, including sports, performing arts, music, art and design, and community service.
        </p>
        <h3>Primary</h3>
        <p>

            The curriculum is divided into two key stages: Key Stage 1 (Years 1 and 2) and Key Stage 2 (Years 3 to 6).<br>
            The curriculum is delivered in English, with an emphasis on the development of high standards of literacy and numeracy.<br>
